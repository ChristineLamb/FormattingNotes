You can add footnotes to your content by using this bracket syntax:

This is footnote number one[^1]
You can also name footnotes using words[^note]

[^1]: first footnote
[^note]: footnote with words

The order in which you write footnotes and other lines does not effect where your footnote will display; it will always display on the bottom
