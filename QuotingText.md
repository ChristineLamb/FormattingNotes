Text that is not a quote

> Text that is a quote

Code in `backticks` will not be formatted. This is ideal for commands

Use triple backticks to put code in its own distinct block:

Some examples of git commands are:
```
git status
git add
git commit
```
To display triple backticks in a fenced code block, wrap them inside quadruple backticks.

````
```
Look! You can see my backticks.
```
````
