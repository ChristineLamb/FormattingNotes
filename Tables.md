You can create tables with pipes | and hyphens -. Hyphens are used to create each column's header, while pipes separate each column. 
You must include a blank line before your table in order for it to correctly render.


| First Header  | Second Header |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |

Cells can vary in width and do not need to be perfectly aligned within columns. There must be at least three hyphens in each column of the header row.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| git status | List all new or modified files |
| git diff | Show file differences that haven't been staged |

You can align text to the left, right, or center of a column by including colons : to the left, right, or on both sides of the hyphens within the header row.

| Left-aligned | Center-aligned | Right-aligned |
